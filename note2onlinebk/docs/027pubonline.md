3. For people who are not comfortable with CMD terminal. [Download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). The rest of the steps assumed you are using github desktop.
4. Clone the repository you just created onto your local computer as shown in {numref}`Figure %s <clone_repo>`.
    ```{figure} /_static/steps/clone_repo.png
    :name: clone_repo

    ```
5. Copy and paste your book folder into the local repository. Now on github desktop you will see all the changes. "Commit to main" and then "Push Origin". You will see your repository populated with all your files.

8. Once that is done. On your local computer, cd to your book folder (the folder should contain the _build directory) and execute the following command.
    ```
    ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html
    ```
