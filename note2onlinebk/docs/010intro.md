Introduction
=============

This is written to guide you through publishing your book online with jupyter-book and hosting it on github. I wrote this guide as an exercise for me to get familiar with the jupyter-book library. At the same time it serves a note for myself. This guide is based on information from [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) for more information please refer to the link.
